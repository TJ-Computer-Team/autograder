                <strong> Rules<br /> </strong> Do NOT submit malicious code with
                malicious intent to the grader. Do NOT attempt to exploit
                any aspect of this system, including but not limited to, accessing
                unauthorized admin privileges, accessing private user information, etc.
                If we find out any misuse, you will be disqualified from participating
                in TJCT competitions, events, and also reported to our sponsors.
                <br /><br />
                Furthermore, please follow all rules given when taking contests on this
                system. Perhaps there will be collaborative contests, but unless
                otherwise stated, contests are individual. All aspects of the TJHSST
                honor code apply.
                <br /><br />
                <% if (!locals.tjioi) { %> In general, please note what you can and
                cannot do for contests. These are subject to change.
                <br />
                1. You ARE allowed to use templates and pre-written datastructures. We
                acknowledge that in-houses are short on time and having pre-written code
                can make the process much less tedious.
                <br />
                2. You ARE allowed to use reference sources online such as language
                specific documentation. General algorithm guides such as GeeksForGeeks
                are allowed if the guide doesn't completely solve the problem.
                <br />
                3. You are NOT allowed consult intelligent sources such as ChatGPT or other Generative AI, as well as any human sources during a
                contest.
                <br />
                4. You are NOT allowed to discuss problem details until the alloted time
                window for the contest is over. <% } %>
                <br /><br />
                During any in-house competition, we will be actively monitoring submissions for plagiarism or use of generative AI
                and will manually review any code that appears suspicious. Submissions flagged for plagiarism may result in disqualification from
                future in-houses and travel competitions.
                <br /><br />
                Thank you for your cooperation.
